# Dutch-Auction-System
Overview
The Dutch Auction System is a Java-based simulation that demonstrates the functionality of a Dutch auction using multi-agent systems. Built on the Java Agent DEvelopment Framework (JADE), this application simulates auctioneer and bidder interactions through a series of interconnected agents.

# Features

Real-Time Auction Management: Tracks auction progress in real-time and adjusts prices dynamically.
Bidder Interactions: Simulates the behavior of multiple bidders responding to the auction.
Logging and Monitoring: Includes comprehensive logging of actions and a monitoring agent that oversees system operations.
