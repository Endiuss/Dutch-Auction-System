# Dutch-Auction-System
Overview
The Dutch Auction System is a Java-based simulation that demonstrates the functionality of a Dutch auction using multi-agent systems. Built on the Java Agent DEvelopment Framework (JADE), this application simulates auctioneer and bidder interactions through a series of interconnected agents.

# Features
Multi-Agent Coordination: Implements several agents that manage different aspects of the auction process, coordinating seamlessly to simulate a real auction environment.
Real-Time Auction Management: Tracks auction progress in real-time and adjusts prices dynamically.
Bidder Interactions: Simulates the behavior of multiple bidders responding to the auction.
Interactive GUI: Provides a graphical user interface for real-time monitoring and management of auction operations.
Logging and Monitoring: Includes comprehensive logging of actions and a monitoring agent that oversees system operations.
# Prerequisites
Java JDK 11 or higher
Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or any compatible Java IDE
JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework)
# Communication
Agents communicate using ACL messages to manage tasks and share information efficiently.
